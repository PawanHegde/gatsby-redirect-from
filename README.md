> ðŸŽ¯ Set redirect urls in your YAML frontmatter within your [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) site's Markdown files. Mimics the behavior of [jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from).

By adding a list of urls to the YAML frontmatter, this plugin creates redirects for all of them at build time. It uses Gatsby's [createRedirect](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/actions/#createRedirect) under the hood.

## Prerequisites

- Gatsby v2
- Markdown files delivered from [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark)
- `slug` on `allMarkdownRemark.edges.node.fields`

Plugin assumes the default setup from [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), with Markdown files processing by [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark) and adding a field `slug` for each file node. Head over to gatsby-starter-blog's [gatsby-node.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/blob/master/gatsby-node.js#L57) file to see how this is done.

## Installation

```bash
cd yourproject/
npm i gatsby-redirect-from
```

Then load the plugin from your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
plugins: ['gatsby-redirect-from']
```

## Usage

In your Markdown file's YAML frontmatter, use the key `redirect_from` followed by a list:

```yaml
---
title: Aperture File Types
redirect_from:
  - /new-goodies-aperture-file-types-icons/
  - /goodie-updated-aperture-file-types-v11/
  - /aperture-file-types-v12-released/
  - /2008/04/aperture-file-types/
  # note: forward slashes are required
---
```

## Plugin Development

```bash
npm i
npm start

# production build
npm run build

# publishing to npm & GitHub releases
# uses https://github.com/webpro/release-it
npm run release
npm run release-minor
npm run release-major
```
