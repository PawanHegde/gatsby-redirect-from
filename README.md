# gatsby-redirect-from

> Set redirect urls in your YAML frontmatter within your [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) site's Markdown files. Mimics the behavior of [jekyll-redirect-from](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from).

By adding a list of urls to the YAML frontmatter, this plugin creates redirects for all of them at build time. It uses Gatsby's [createRedirect](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/actions/#createRedirect) under the hood.

## Prerequisites

- Gatsby v2
- only parses Markdown files delivered from [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark)
- `slug` on `fields`

## Installation

```bash
cd yourproject/
npm i gatsby-redirect-from
```

Then load the plugin from your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
plugins: ['gatsby-redirect-from']
```

## Usage

In your Markdown file's YAML frontmatter, use the key `redirect_from` followed by a list:

```yaml
---
title: Aperture File Types
redirect_from:
  # forward slashes are required
  - /new-goodies-aperture-file-types-icons/
  - /goodie-updated-aperture-file-types-v11/
  - /aperture-file-types-v12-released/
  - /2008/04/aperture-file-types/
---
```
